# A real-life example of a clustering problem with business-minded aspects: segmenting store customers
The purpose of this project is to deal with a **real world clustering problem and approach it with a business concern**: from explaining the insights we can get just from the data, find a ML model that would fit on the clustering problem and finally put into production the model and the insights we can get from it.

For this project I've chosen [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) Kaggle dataset. This dataset contains information of clients of a store: from personal information to the money spend in different sections of the store. 

In the case of a business, how to take [advantage](https://analyticahouse.com/blog/importance-customer-segmentation) of the information of your customers? Well, if we are able to segment our customers will also be able to develop a deeper understanding of them and **develop specific marketing strategies** for them.

Final results can be retrieved by POST. An **API has been built in order to able request which group a customer belongs** to based on their data in order they can receive automatically specific offers based on the group they belong. An example of a possible request and a response could be as the following:
